### SMICLR

The official PyTorch implementation of SMICLR: Contrastive Learning on Multiple Molecular Representations for Semisupervised and Unsupervised Representation Learning. SMICLR jointly trains a graph encoder and an encoder for the simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) string to perform the contrastive learning objective.
